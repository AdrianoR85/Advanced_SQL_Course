ðŸ“Š 2. What to do with this data?

- Option 1: Visualize
Use line charts for each client to see the changes. If there is a repeating pattern month after month, this suggests seasonality.

- Option 2: Calculate standard deviation and coefficient of variation
Clients with high variation over the months might be seasonal.

- Option 3: Statistical analysis (advanced, optional)
Use autocorrelation or time series decomposition (for example, in Python with statsmodels or Prophet).
