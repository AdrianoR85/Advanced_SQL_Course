## 🎮 Game Store Project

This is a simple database for a fake game store.  
I use it to learn how to:

- Create tables
- Use foreign keys
- Write SELECT queries
- Analyze sales and customers

### 🗺️ Database Diagram

![Game Store Database](./Game%20Store%20Project/Model/game_store_model.png)

### 🧱 Tables in the Project

- `Customer` – People who buy games  
- `Address` – Customer address  
- `Employee` – Store workers  
- `Purchase` – Orders from customers  
- `Purchase_item` – Items in each order  
- `Product` – Games in the store  
- `Category` – Type of game (Action, Adventure, etc.)

You can find the SQL code in the [Game Store folder](./Game%20Store%20Project) <!-- Edite se o nome da pasta for diferente -->

## 🪟 Window Functions

This folder has code examples using:

- `ROW_NUMBER()`
- `RANK()`
- `DENSE_RANK()`
- `LEAD()` and `LAG()`

These are advanced SQL functions.  
They help to compare rows and make better analysis.

Find the code [here](./window-functions) <!-- Edite conforme o caminho real -->
